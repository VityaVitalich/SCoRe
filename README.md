# SCoRE

This repository contains code to reproduce paper [Training Language Models to Self-Correct via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12917) with [TRL Framework](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/tree/main) and DeepSpeed support.

The reward functions and prompt buiders are based on the paper [Self-Taught Self-Correction for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08681) implementation.
